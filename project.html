<h1 style="font-family:Cambria;">My Virtual Future</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:Cambria;">"Great Hairy Aspirations" of Nick Young</h2>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:Cambria;">Virtual Reality is something that until recently was only in the highest of fictions, but now companies like Google, Microsoft, 
and Meta are making this future happen now. I believe that there are endless ways and opportunities that
virtual reality can help leaders in multiple fields such as education, construcion, entertainment,
and so many more. I want to be a part of making virtual/augmented reality an integral part of our world. </p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p style="font-family:Cambria;">
Virtual/Augmented Reality can revolutionize how people learn, especially at a collegiate level. 
<ul style="font-family:Cambria;">
<li>Imagine if a med student could simulate surgery before ever having to touch a kidney. With VR/AR we could create a program
that could accurately simulate the internal reactions of the body when certain maneuvers are performed, better preparing the student for the real
deal while also limiting the need for cadavers and other current methods.</li> <li>With VR/AR, students in the science/math avenues could have access
to a whiteboard without limits. This would help the most theoretical ideas and formulas become reality.</li> <li>History students could relive certain events before their very eyes. 
Archaeology majors could experience the ruins they study firsthand, without ever needing to leave campus.</li> </p>
</ul>

<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p style="font-family:Cambria;">
To see the potential for Virtual/Augmented Reality in entertainment, one simply needs to see how many companies are making their own VR Headset and marketing it to virtually every demographic.
<ul style="font-family:Cambria;">
<li>Meta, a social media company, purchased the company Oculus who had developed some of the first commercially available VR headsets. With this aquisition, they are currently developing a 
social space of their own wherin users could interact with their friends, playing games or watching movies or TV, all while being miles apart in the real world.</li>
<li>Valve and Sony, who specialize in video games and associated technology, have made VR systems that are focused towards (unsurprisingly) video games! With the tech they've made, people can explore their favorite fictional worlds like Star Wars,
Skyrim, and even the Marvel Cinematic Universe as they never could before.</li>
<li>Google and Microsoft, both major tech companies have also started making their way into the VR/AR realm. Google has introduced their Google Glass, which is a device that resembles an average pair of eyeglasses but has a heads-up display in lieu of lenses.
Since introduction, the Google Glass has been through many prototypes and versions and they are still making new innovations that will help make the device available to more and more people.</ul> </p>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p style="font-family:Cambria;">
Imagine 3D blueprints and schematics that you could change and examine with a wave of your hand, or assembling theoretical machines with ease. (Tony Stark style?)
<ul style="font-family:Cambria;">
<li>Building new structures or even modifying existing ones would be expedited with technology that could show the finished product in a 3D model instead of on paper. This could also make the build sites safer by simulating various environmental factors both man-made and not.</li>
<li>City Planning would change entirely, allowing planners to simulate expected day to day activity in a certain area long before ground is broken on any new or experimental building.</li>
<li>Engineers could use VR/AR to make breakthroughs in auto design, fuel efficiency, and even space travel!</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Point!</h2>
<p style="font-family:Cambria;">
At the end of the day I am super passionate about the potential of Virtual and Augmented Reality to change how we live our everyday lives and I believe that to pursue this passion, Holberton is the natural next step. Which happens to be where I grew up, right here in Tulsa!<br><b>Thanks for reading!
